I am currently a tenure-track associate professor at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), China. My main research area is to design and apply cryptographic technologies to protect information security. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. Jianhua Chen and Prof. Debiao He. I obtained my B.S. and M.S. from Wuhan University in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

## Research Interests

My research interest is to apply cryptographic technologies to protect information security, including:
 - **Data and Identify Privacy**: Build cryptographic systems for various secure goals, such as traditional confidentiality and integrity, encrypted data processing, anonymous authentication, etc.
 - **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Mainly use elliptic curve isogeny or group action to design PQC schemes, such as identity-based signatures, public-key encryption, ring signatures, etc.
 - **Software/Hardware Implementation**: Code on different platforms to improve cryptographic scheme efficiency, such as SIMD acceleration, GPU acceleration, FPGA acceleration, etc.
